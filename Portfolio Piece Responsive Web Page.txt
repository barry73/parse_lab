Using either the 300 page or the Parse product landing page we worked on together as a base, implement an original, complete responsive web page. This project should serve as your first portfolio piece and it's recommended you invest about 20 hours of work over the next 2 weeks before the due date.


Sandi Ma:
Hi class, since you are working on a "portfolio" piece--if you are not sure which theme, topic, product to focus on and want an idea--then focus on YOURSELF! Make this portfolio piece YOUR PORTFOLIO piece.




Portfolio Piece: Responsive Web Page
Due Date: Submit your progress on Schoology by June 13th *
* By 6/13 your entire project need not be complete but there should be clear progress and in a state where instructor and TAs can give you feedback. Target 6/20 for full project completion.

We have now implemented two fully responsive web pages, the 300: Rise of an Empire
movie page, and the Parse product landing page. You can see previews of these from
your phone if you’d like:

Parse Product Landing: http://goo.gl/008HFW


Using either (or both) of these projects as a base, implement a complete responsive web
page. Here are three suggested options:


Project Portfolio Page
Coming out of FEWD one of the most important pieces you’ll have is a portfolio of
professional-quality projects you've worked on, representing some of the latest
techniques in front-end web application development. Build a page that showcases your
work. This is the most "real" project option you can do, as you will build a page allowing
users to browse your work. Those looking to enter web development as a career are
highly encouraged to choose this project option.
Implementation suggestion: The Parse product landing page is a suitable base for this.
Consider showcasing your work in a grid (where the company logos currently reside).
Where the Parse headline and narrative texts reside is a great place to talk about your
FEWD journey, your bio/background, or anything else you'd like readers to know. The
overall page need not be too much more complex than what the Parse page is now, but
no less complex.


Movie or Music Promotional Page
Displaying rich media on the web is easier than ever, with <img>, the hero pattern we
learned, and the IFrame pattern capable of showing a YouTube video. Use the 300: Rise
of an Empire page as a starting point to promote your favorite movie(s) or music. It
doesn’t have to focus on a single movie/artist; look at iTunes for inspiration on displaying
collections of artists. Note that it is not sufficient to just replace the text and images of
the existing 300 page we built. You must change the layout in a meaningful way, and
ideally add more content. Check out Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB for inspiration on
content you might add. As this is a media page, it’s expected you make use of plenty of
images, IFrame/YouTube video and/or the swipeable gallery.


Product or Informational Landing Page
Using either a fictitious or real product, produce a landing page educating the audience
about its key features, its value proposition, and possibly a call to action to try / download
it. The Parse landing page is a good starting point, but please alter the layout and add
content rather than just replacing existing text/images. In many startup, marketing, and
agency settings, this type of product or informational landing page is very common and
it’s valuable to be able to present information in a variety of grid-based layouts.


Acceptance / Grading Criteria
- Uses a nav header that serves as an overall header for your page. Need not
actually have navigational <a> links, but should "brand" your page.
- Design looks professional and appropriate on devices from phones to typical
desktop monitors.
- Centers key content you wish to draw readers' attention to, such as text and
images. Must use text and images throughout (e.g. cannot be a text-only page).
- Uses Bootstrap's responsive grid to lay out at least one portion of your page.
- Craftsmanship points: there is an expectation of portfolio quality to this site. You
can use either 300 or Parse as the start, but please aim to create new content, and
especially new layouts using Bootstrap's responsive grid. For a portfolio-quality
piece, TAs and instructors estimate 15, ideally 20 hours of work on your site over
the next two weeks outside of class. As always, instructional team is available for
you should you need extra help.
